simple text adventure in java

I've wanted to write an old-school no gfx text adventure for a long time, and I started this originally in c++ as a way to really get comfortable using it, because although I've been programming for 30 years I've never been able to grasp c/c++.
However, I admit defeat, and switched to java since I know it better and hate reinventing the wheel everytime which is what c++ makes you do. 
Anyway, I am now doing this in java, and concurrently in c# (not put onto github yet).
I want to make a text dungeon-crawler that has a more RPG-style combat system, and a simple, easy to use GUI.
